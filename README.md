# Chat-Example
A chat app for training NodeJS, Express, Socket.io and Pug skills

***

  A chat-example for newbies like me.

  Everyone who is just starting to learn code, just like I am, is invited to participate / fork / collaborate / make questions / suggestions, or anything related. 

  There are to basic ideas around this project:
### Learn and share.

  Learn with others. Reading someone else's code is always helpful.
  So is discussing the multiple ways to achieve a goal, or get something done.
  It is really important to get some experience at team-coding.
  And it is always helpful to have someone to share with, even if it's just your ideas, or those
  lovely moments when you get stuck in the puzzle.

### So, please...

  If you are someone who knows just-a-bit of code, and don't know where to start, this is **your** place.

   Remember, everyone's welcome.
